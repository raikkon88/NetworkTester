# Network Tester 

## Description

Using this program you will be able to send amounts of requests in a network from a unique computer. Not only network requests even you can execute same command in prallel n times where n is a number given for you as parameter. 

## Requirements

**You need a Linux machine to execute this program**

This software is prepared to send : 

- http requests
- arp requests

This software is prepared to execute any instruction in paralÂ·lel n times. 

## Usage 

    java -jar networkTester <type> -m <int> [-I -d <seconds> -i <increment>]

Where : 

To do http requests.  
    
    java -jar networkTester http <host> -n <int>
    
To do arping requests.

    java -jar networkTester arping <host> <mac> -n <int>  
 
To do any terminal command. 
    
    java -jar networkTester executable -n <int> [-I -d <seconds> -i <increment>] "<instruction>"

## Functionalities

You are able to execute the parallel instruction in two ways. 

### Simultaneous 

Means -n parameter stands for the maximum number of processes that you will generate and the program will start all together.

### Incremental
 
Means groups of processes will be generated and thrown with a delay in seconds between each one and with a incremental value. 

- -d : <int> stands for the delay between each group of processes in milliseconds. 
- -i : <int> stands for the incremental number

For instance. 

In case you put the parameters -n 1000 -I -d 1000 -i 10 the result will be : 

    10 processes 
    20 processes 
    30 processes 
    .
    .
    .
    100 processes. 
    
You will throw a total number of 550 processes. 

## Output 

The program will print the same output that will be thrown from command line, it means that you can redirect this output to files.
